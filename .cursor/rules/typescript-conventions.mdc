# TypeScript Conventions

## Type Safety

- Use TypeScript strictly - avoid `any` types
- Import types from `@pacto-p2p/types` when available
- Define types in `packages/types` for shared types
- Use proper type definitions for all functions and components

## Code Style

- Use Biome for formatting and linting (not ESLint)
- Run `npm run biome:format` before committing
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use consistent naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types

## File Organization

- Keep related code together
- Use index.ts files for clean exports
- Follow the existing directory structure patterns
- Separate concerns: components, hooks, services, types
