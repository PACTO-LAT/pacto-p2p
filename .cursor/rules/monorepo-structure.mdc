# Monorepo Structure Rules

This is a Turborepo monorepo with npm workspaces. Follow these conventions:

## Package Organization

- **`apps/web`**: Next.js web application (main app)
- **`packages/shared`**: Business logic, services, and utilities
- **`packages/ui`**: Reusable UI components (Radix UI based)
- **`packages/types`**: TypeScript type definitions
- **`packages/config`**: Configuration and scripts

## Workspace Dependencies

- Always use `workspace:*` for internal package dependencies
- Import from workspace packages using `@pacto-p2p/<package-name>`
- Example: `import { Button } from '@pacto-p2p/ui'`

## Code Organization

- Keep packages focused on single responsibilities
- Share code through workspace packages, not by copying files
- Use TypeScript for all packages
- Follow the existing package structure patterns

## Building

- Use `npm run build` to build all packages
- Use `npm run dev` to start development
- Turbo handles caching and parallel execution automatically
