# Component Patterns

## Component Structure

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Export components from index files for clean imports
- Keep components focused and composable
- Separate presentational and container components

## UI Package (`packages/ui`)

- All reusable UI components go in `packages/ui`
- Use Radix UI primitives as base
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`

## Component Organization

- Group related components in subdirectories
- Use descriptive component names
- Keep component files focused (one main component per file)
- Co-locate related components (e.g., `_components/` folders)

## Props and Types

- Define prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Use shared types from `@pacto-p2p/types` when possible
- Make props optional with sensible defaults
- Document complex props with JSDoc comments

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Support dark mode via theme provider
- Use CSS variables for theme colors
- Keep styles co-located with components
